/*
In this example we use a simple user manager made for testing and didactical purposes.

The user manager is made of 4 PHP classes and 2 definition files, which are respectively
in model/classes/um and model/definitions/um. It is called 'um' and lives in the 
'um' namespace. This is why, if you want to call the um User type, you have to
write 'um_User'. Notice that all its properties as well will be in this namespace
(quite transparently for the user), and that in reality they are 'um_email', 
'um_nickname' and so forth, what means that they will never conflict with your
property names.

Have a look at the um classes and definitions, since they really contain a lot of 
useful stuff, such as recursive tree search and all best practices to be 'inheritable'
from different namespaces than yours without having troubles with
namespace issues. 

In this file we use those classes, test them and illustrate a bit how they can be used.

In particular we create a class called User (you'll find the def in the definitions
directory of course) that extends um_User. We could do the same with um_Group.

This illustrates how it is possible to create sef-contained functional bundles 
(as the um), nicely incapsulated in an API, and that others can use to add those
functionalities to their custom nodes. By the way, if you like the user manager 
feel free to use it in your projects. You'll simply have to copy the two 'um'
directories in 'definitins' and 'classes' to your classpath directory.

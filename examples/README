THE GRAPHENE EXAMPLES

The main purpose of these examples is to illustrate how Graphene can be used,
so please have a look at the code and comments inside.

The SimpleBookshop example shows some basic data creation and gives a glimpse of 
what you can do with the query language. 
The UserManager example instead shows lots of advanced stuff like:
	- how to use inheritance to build self-contained functional bundles
	- how to implement recursive search
	- how to use effectively restrictions and specifications in the def files

	
Secondly, since for the moment there are no unity tests, these examples should 
serve as well as tests. If you change something and run them without problems
there is a strong chance you didn't break anything.

RUNNING THE EXAMPLES

First of all you have to create a db.json file in the examples directory containing 
you database connection parameters. Something like:
	{
		"host":"localhost",
		"user":"root",
		"pwd":"root",
		"db":"test",
		"port":null,
		"prefix":"examples",
		"classpath":"./model"
	}

and make sure the database exists, is reacheable, that you have the right to 
create tables, insert, select, update and so forth.

You can run the examples by the command line (provided you have the php-cli installed)
by moving to the examples directory and typing:

	php SimpleBookshop.php
	php UserManager.php
	
Or you can call them via HTTP from you browser:

	http://{your-host}/{your-graphene-dir}/examples/SimpleBookshop.php
	http://{your-host}/{your-graphene-dir}/examples/SimpleBookshop.php
